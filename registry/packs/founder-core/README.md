# Founder Core Pack

The essentials every solo founder needs to get their AI up to speed.

## What's included

- **core/identity.md** — Your founder identity, background, and communication preferences
- **core/team.md** — Your team, advisors, and key collaborators
- **venture/my-venture.md** — Your venture with status, metrics, and strategy
- **planning/goals.md** — Quarterly and yearly goals with OKR framework
- **planning/pipeline.md** — Deal pipeline and opportunity tracking

## Installation

```
know install ./founder-core
```

## How to use

After installing, fill in each file with your actual information. The trigger keywords are already set — your AI will automatically load the right context based on what you're discussing.

## Pack format

This pack uses `merge_strategy: "skip"` — it won't overwrite any files you've already customized. Safe to install on an existing knowledge base.
