# SaaS Sales Starter Pack

A complete sales system for SaaS founders who are doing their own selling.

## What's included

- **sales/methodology.md** — A founder-friendly sales process from first touch to close
- **sales/objections.md** — The 12 most common SaaS objections with proven responses
- **sales/icp.md** — ICP framework that actually helps you qualify faster

## Installation

```
know install ./saas-sales-starter
```

## How to use

This pack installs with `merge_strategy: "append"` — if you already have sales files, the new content is added below a divider. Your existing content stays untouched.

After installing:
1. Customize the ICP with your actual buyer profiles
2. Adjust objection responses to match your product
3. Modify the methodology stages to fit your sales cycle

## Who this is for

Solo founders and small teams doing founder-led sales. The methodology is designed for high-touch B2B SaaS with $500-$50K ACV.
