# Founder-Led SaaS Sales Methodology

## Philosophy

Sell like a consultant, not a salesperson. Your unfair advantage as a founder is that you built the product — you understand the problem better than any sales rep ever could. Use that.

**Core principle:** Diagnose before you prescribe. Never pitch until you understand their pain.

## The 5 stages

### Stage 1: Prospecting & Outreach

**Goal:** Get to a conversation with someone who has the problem you solve.

**Channels (ranked by conversion for early-stage SaaS):**
1. Warm introductions from existing customers/network
2. Targeted LinkedIn outreach (not spray-and-pray)
3. Cold email to ICP-match accounts
4. Content-driven inbound (LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads)

**Cold outreach framework:**
- **Line 1:** Something specific about them (proves you did research)
- **Line 2:** The problem you solve (in their language, not yours)
- **Line 3:** Social proof or credibility signal
- **Line 4:** Soft CTA ("Worth a conversation?")

**Cadence:** 3 touches over 10 days. If no response, wait 30 days, try a different angle.

### Stage 2: Discovery Call

**Goal:** Understand their pain deeply enough to prescribe, not pitch.

**Duration:** 25-30 minutes. You should talk 30% of the time max.

**Key questions:**
- "Walk me through what happens when [problem] occurs..."
- "How are you handling this today?"
- "What have you tried so far? What worked, what didn't?"
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
- "Who else is affected by this problem?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"

**Listen for:**
- Urgency signals: timeline, budget allocated, executive sponsor
- Pain depth: is this a nice-to-have or a need-to-have?
- Decision process: who else needs to approve?

**Red flags to disqualify:**
- No budget and no urgency to find budget
- Problem is low priority (ranks below #3 on their list)
- No decision-maker access

### Stage 3: Demo / Solution Presentation

**Goal:** Show them their future, not your features.

**Structure:**
1. **Recap their pain** (2 min) — "Last time you mentioned X, Y, Z..."
2. **Show the workflow** (10 min) — Walk through THEIR use case, not a generic demo
3. **Highlight the delta** (3 min) — "Today this takes you X hours. With us, it takes Y minutes."
4. **Social proof** (2 min) — "[Similar company] reduced [metric] by [X]%"
5. **Next steps** (3 min) — Never end without a clear next action

**Rules:**
- Never demo features they didn't ask about
- Use their data/terminology if possible
- If they ask about a feature you don't have, say so honestly

### Stage 4: Proposal & Negotiation

**Goal:** Make it easy to say yes.

**Proposal structure:**
1. Problem summary (their words)
2. Proposed solution (mapped to their pain)
3. Pricing (simple, clear, no hidden fees)
4. Timeline (implementation plan)
5. Social proof (relevant case study)

**Pricing psychology:**
- Always present 2-3 options (anchor to highest)
- Annual contracts: offer 15-20% discount for annual prepay
- Never discount more than 20% — discount velocity, not price

**Common stalls and responses:**
- "Let me think about it" → "Of course. What specific concerns should I address before your next discussion?"
- "We need to check with [person]" → "Happy to join that conversation. What would be most helpful for them to see?"
- "Can you do better on price?" → "The pricing reflects the value. But I can adjust the scope if budget is a constraint."

### Stage 5: Close & Handoff

**Goal:** Ink the deal and set up for success.

**Closing signals:**
- Asking about implementation timeline
- Introducing you to other stakeholders
- Asking about contract terms
- "What do next steps look like?"

**Close cleanly:**
1. Send contract same day as verbal yes
2. Follow up within 24 hours if not signed
3. After signing: immediate welcome email with onboarding timeline
4. Schedule kickoff call within 48 hours

**Post-close:**
- Log the deal with append_decision()
- Update pipeline metrics
- Ask for referral within 30 days of going live
