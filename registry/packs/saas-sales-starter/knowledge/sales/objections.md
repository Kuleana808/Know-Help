# SaaS Objection Handling Guide

## Framework: AER (Acknowledge, Explore, Redirect)

Every objection follows the same pattern:
1. **Acknowledge** — Validate their concern. Never dismiss.
2. **Explore** — Understand the real issue behind the stated concern.
3. **Redirect** — Reframe toward the value.

## The 12 Most Common SaaS Objections

### 1. "It's too expensive"

**What they mean:** They don't see enough value to justify the cost.

- **Acknowledge:** "I understand — budget matters, especially at [their stage]."
- **Explore:** "Help me understand: is it the total price, or the price relative to what you'd expect for this?"
- **Redirect:** "Let's map this to the problem. You mentioned [pain] costs you [X hours/dollars] per month. At [price], this pays for itself in [Y] months."

### 2. "We're already using [Competitor]"

**What they mean:** Switching costs feel high.

- **Acknowledge:** "Makes sense — [Competitor] is a solid tool."
- **Explore:** "What's working well? And what's the one thing you wish it did better?"
- **Redirect:** "Most of our customers switched from [Competitor] specifically because of [differentiator]. The migration takes [X] days and we handle it."

### 3. "We can build this ourselves"

**What they mean:** They think it's simpler than it is.

- **Acknowledge:** "Your team is clearly capable."
- **Explore:** "Have you estimated the build + maintenance cost? Most teams find it's 3-5x what they expected."
- **Redirect:** "Building means you're investing engineering cycles in [non-core thing] instead of [their core product]. We handle [X] so your team can focus on [Y]."

### 4. "The timing isn't right"

**What they mean:** It's not a priority yet (or they're not feeling enough pain).

- **Acknowledge:** "Timing is everything."
- **Explore:** "What would need to change for the timing to be right? Is there a trigger event coming up?"
- **Redirect:** "Most customers wish they'd started sooner. The onboarding takes [X] weeks, so starting now means you're ready before [their deadline/event]."

### 5. "I need to talk to my [boss/team/board]"

**What they mean:** They can't make the decision alone.

- **Acknowledge:** "Totally fair — important decisions need alignment."
- **Explore:** "What would be most helpful for that conversation? I can put together a one-pager or join the call."
- **Redirect:** "Happy to provide whatever [decision-maker] needs. What are their top 2 concerns likely to be?"

### 6. "Can you offer a discount?"

**What they mean:** They want to feel like they got a deal.

- **Acknowledge:** "I appreciate you being direct about budget."
- **Explore:** "Is it the total contract value, or the monthly commitment?"
- **Redirect:** "Our pricing reflects the value. I can offer [annual discount / adjusted scope / extended trial] — which would be most helpful?"

### 7. "We don't have budget right now"

**What they mean:** Either genuinely no budget, or not a priority.

- **Acknowledge:** "Understood. Budget constraints are real."
- **Explore:** "When does your next budget cycle start? And is this something that would be allocated there?"
- **Redirect:** "Let's stay in touch for [next quarter]. In the meantime, I'll share some resources on [related topic]. Would a free pilot help build the internal case?"

### 8. "It looks too complex"

**What they mean:** They're worried about implementation effort.

- **Acknowledge:** "That's a valid concern. Nobody wants another tool that collects dust."
- **Explore:** "Which part feels complex? The setup, the daily use, or the integration?"
- **Redirect:** "We handle [implementation/migration]. Average time-to-value is [X days]. Here's what onboarding looks like: [walk through simple steps]."

### 9. "What if it doesn't work for us?"

**What they mean:** They've been burned before.

- **Acknowledge:** "Healthy skepticism. Buying software that doesn't deliver is the worst."
- **Explore:** "What would 'working' look like for you? Let's define success criteria."
- **Redirect:** "We offer [trial/pilot/money-back]. And here's [case study] — they had the same concern and saw [result] in [timeframe]."

### 10. "We need more features"

**What they mean:** There's a gap between their expectation and your current product.

- **Acknowledge:** "Appreciate you being specific about what you need."
- **Explore:** "Which features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves? How would you prioritize them?"
- **Redirect:** "[Feature X] is on our roadmap for [quarter]. For [Feature Y], here's how our customers work around it today: [workaround]. Would that work for now?"

### 11. "Send me more information"

**What they mean:** Often a polite brush-off.

- **Acknowledge:** "Happy to."
- **Explore:** "What specific questions are you trying to answer? I want to send you exactly the right thing."
- **Redirect:** "Rather than a generic deck, let me put together a quick summary tailored to [their situation]. Can we schedule 10 minutes to walk through it?"

### 12. "We're in a contract with [Competitor]"

**What they mean:** Locked in, at least temporarily.

- **Acknowledge:** "Contracts are contracts. When does yours expire?"
- **Explore:** "Is there an early termination option? Some vendors will negotiate if you're switching."
- **Redirect:** "Let's plan the transition for [expiry date]. We can start onboarding a month before so you're live on day one. I'll follow up in [X] months."
