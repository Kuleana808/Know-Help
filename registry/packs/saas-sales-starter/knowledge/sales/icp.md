# Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Framework

## Why ICP matters

Selling to everyone means selling to no one. Your ICP defines who you should spend time on — and more importantly, who you should disqualify fast.

**Rule of thumb:** If a prospect doesn't match 3+ of your ICP criteria, they're probably a bad fit. Politely disqualify and move on.

## ICP Definition Template

### Company profile

| Attribute | Ideal fit | Acceptable | Disqualify |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Industry | [e.g., B2B SaaS] | [Adjacent industries] | [Industries you can't serve] |
| Company size | [e.g., 10-200 employees] | [5-500] | [<5 or >500] |
| Revenue | [e.g., $1M-$50M ARR] | [$500K-$100M] | [Pre-revenue or >$100M] |
| Stage | [e.g., Series A-B] | [Seed-C] | [Pre-seed or Public] |
| Tech stack | [e.g., Uses Slack + modern tools] | [Flexible] | [Legacy-only stacks] |

### Buyer persona

| Attribute | Primary buyer | Secondary buyer | Influencer |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Title | [e.g., VP of Sales] | [e.g., CRO] | [e.g., Sales Manager] |
| Reports to | [e.g., CRO/CEO] | [e.g., CEO/Board] | [e.g., VP Sales] |
| KPIs they own | [e.g., Revenue, pipeline] | [e.g., Company growth] | [e.g., Team output] |
| Daily frustration | [e.g., "Can't see pipeline clearly"] | [e.g., "Growth is slowing"] | [e.g., "Tools don't talk to each other"] |

### Pain signals (how to spot them)

**Strong buy signals:**
- They're actively searching for solutions (inbound)
- They've outgrown their current tool
- New leadership is pushing for change
- They recently raised funding (new budget)
- Competitor just adopted your category

**Weak signals (not ready yet):**
- Casually browsing, no timeline
- Happy with current solution
- No budget authority
- Problem is known but not prioritized

## Qualification framework: BANT+

Score every prospect on these 5 criteria:

| Criteria | Strong (3) | Medium (2) | Weak (1) |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Budget** | Allocated, approved | Identified, needs approval | No budget discussed |
| **Authority** | Decision-maker in room | Can influence decision | No access to buyer |
| **Need** | Acute pain, active search | Known problem, not urgent | Nice-to-have |
| **Timeline** | This quarter | This half | No timeline |
| **Fit** | Perfect ICP match | Acceptable match | Edge case |

**Score 12+:** Priority — fast-track this deal
**Score 8-11:** Qualified — worth pursuing, nurture timeline
**Score <8:** Disqualify — politely exit, revisit later

## Anti-ICP: Who to say no to

Just as important as knowing your ICP is knowing who wastes your time:

- **Feature shoppers:** Want everything custom, won't pay premium for it
- **Free-tier campers:** Will never convert, drain support resources
- **Wrong stage:** Too early (no real problem yet) or too late (needs enterprise, you're not ready)
- **Bad culture fit:** Abusive to support, unreasonable expectations
- **Slow bureaucracy:** 6-month procurement cycles when you need fast revenue

## Tracking your ICP

After every won deal, log:
- Which ICP criteria they matched
- What was the buying trigger?
- How long was the sales cycle?
- What was the close rate for this profile?

After every lost deal, log:
- Which criteria were weak?
- Was this actually ICP or did you force it?

**Update your ICP quarterly** based on these patterns.
