# Creator Voice Pack

Your LinkedIn voice isn't your Twitter voice. Your AI should know the difference.

## What you get

Four detailed voice guides that teach your AI exactly how you write:

- Platform-specific voice and tone for LinkedIn, Twitter, and newsletters
- Post frameworks and templates for each platform
- A universal style guide that captures your writing DNA

## Sample content

> **LinkedIn voice rules:**
> - Open with a pattern interrupt — not "I'm excited to share"
> - One idea per post. Go deep, not wide.
> - End with a question or clear takeaway, never "Thoughts?"

Customize with your own examples and watch your AI match your voice.
