# Universal Writing Style Guide

## My writing DNA

### Voice characteristics
- **Direct:** Say it plainly. No corporate-speak, no jargon unless the audience expects it.
- **Concise:** Every sentence earns its place. If it doesn't add value, cut it.
- **Specific:** Use numbers, names, and examples instead of vague claims.
- **Confident:** Write with conviction. Hedging weakens everything.
- **Human:** Write like you talk. Contractions are fine. Fragments are fine. Starting sentences with "And" or "But" is fine.

### What I always do
- Lead with the insight, not the context
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max for body copy)
- Bold the important parts so scanners get the gist
- End with something actionable — not "Thoughts?" or "Let me know"
- Use analogies to make complex things simple

### What I never do
- Use passive voice when active voice is clearer
- Write "in order to" (just say "to")
- Use "leverage" as a verb (use "use")
- Write "utilize" (use "use")
- Start with "So" or "Basically"
- Use exclamation marks in professional writing (one per email max, if any)
- Write "I think" or "I believe" — just state the thing

## Formatting rules

### General
- Bullet points > numbered lists (unless order matters)
- Tables for comparisons
- One idea per paragraph
- Subheadings every 200-300 words in long-form content

### Emails
- Subject line: 5-8 words. Specific. No "Quick question" or "Following up"
- First sentence: why you're writing. Not pleasantries.
- Last sentence: clear ask or next step
- Max 5 paragraphs for cold emails, 3 for internal

### Presentations
- One idea per slide
- Max 6 words in a headline
- Use the "so what?" test: every slide should answer why the audience should care

## Words and phrases

### Use these
- "Here's what happened"
- "The short version"
- "What this means"
- "Specifically"
- "For example"
- "In practice"

### Avoid these
- "Synergy" / "synergize"
- "Circle back"
- "Deep dive" (unless literal)
- "Moving forward"
- "Reach out"
- "Touch base"
- "At the end of the day"
- "It goes without saying" (then don't say it)

## Tone by context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| LinkedIn | Professional, insightful | "Here's what 200 sales calls taught me about discovery..." |
| Twitter | Sharp, direct, opinionated | "Most founder sales advice is wrong. Here's what actually works:" |
| Newsletter | Conversational, detailed | "I've been thinking about this all week. Let me explain..." |
| Cold email | Respectful, specific, brief | "I noticed [specific thing]. We help companies like yours [solve X]." |
| Investor update | Data-forward, honest | "Revenue: $42K (+18% MoM). Here's what's working and what's not." |
| Internal/team | Casual, actionable | "Quick update on the launch. Three things to know:" |
