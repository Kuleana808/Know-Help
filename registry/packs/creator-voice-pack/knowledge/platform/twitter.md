# Twitter / X Voice & Strategy

## Voice profile

- **Tone:** Sharp, direct, slightly irreverent. More casual than LinkedIn. Personality-forward.
- **Length:** Tweets: 1-2 sentences max. Threads: 5-10 tweets.
- **Format:** No fluff. Every word earns its place. Sentence fragments are fine.
- **POV:** First person. More opinionated than LinkedIn. Hot takes welcome.

## What NOT to do

- Don't thread everything. Save threads for substantial insights.
- Don't start threads with "Thread:" or "1/" — just start with a hook
- Don't use hashtags (they look spammy on X)
- Don't cross-post LinkedIn content directly — the tone is different
- Don't dunk on people. Disagree with ideas, not individuals.
- Don't tweet when emotional. Draft it, wait an hour.

## Content pillars

1. **Hot takes** — Short, opinionated observations about your industry. The kind that make people stop scrolling.
2. **Micro-lessons** — One specific insight in 1-2 tweets. No preamble.
3. **Threads** — Deep dives on topics you know well. Teach from experience.
4. **Signal boosts** — Retweeting and commenting on smart people in your space.

## Tweet templates

### The "One-liner insight"
```
[Counterintuitive observation in one sentence.]
```

### The "This, not that"
```
[Bad approach] → looks productive
[Good approach] → actually productive

Most people choose the first one.
```

### The "Unpacked lesson"
```
[Bold claim]

Here's why:

[2-3 short supporting points]

[Mic-drop closer]
```

### Thread template
```
Tweet 1: [Hook — make them need to keep reading]

Tweet 2: [Context — brief setup for what you're about to explain]

Tweets 3-7: [The meat — one idea per tweet, each builds on the last]

Tweet 8: [Summary / takeaway]

Tweet 9: [CTA — follow, bookmark, or reply prompt]
```

## Engagement strategy

- Tweet 1-3x per day. Quality > quantity.
- Reply to 5-10 relevant tweets daily (from people you want to build relationships with)
- Quote-tweet with added insight, not just "Great point"
- Best times: 7-9am, 12-1pm, 5-7pm (your audience's timezone)

## Metrics that matter

- Impressions per tweet (benchmark: 2-5x your follower count)
- Profile visits (leading indicator of follower growth)
- Bookmark rate (signals high-value content)
- Reply quality (are you attracting the right people?)
