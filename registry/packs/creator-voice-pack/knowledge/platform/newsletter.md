# Newsletter Voice & Strategy

## Voice profile

- **Tone:** Conversational and insightful. Like a smart email from a friend who happens to know a lot about [your topic]. Not academic. Not corporate.
- **Length:** 800-1,500 words. Respect their inbox.
- **Format:** Short paragraphs. Subheadings every 3-4 paragraphs. Bold key phrases. One clear takeaway.
- **POV:** First person. You're writing to one person, not a crowd.

## Newsletter structure template

```
Subject line: [Specific + curiosity-inducing. 5-8 words max.]

Preview text: [First sentence should hook — it shows in inbox preview]

---

[Opening: 2-3 sentences that set the scene. Start with a story, observation, or question — never "In this issue..."]

[Section 1: The main insight — what you're exploring today]

[Section 2: The evidence or experience — what happened, what you saw, what the data says]

[Section 3: The takeaway — what this means for the reader. Be specific and actionable.]

---

[Closing: 1-2 sentences. Personal, warm. Invite replies.]
```

## What NOT to do

- Don't open with "Happy [day of week]!"
- Don't include more than 1 CTA per email
- Don't pad with filler — if you don't have 800 words of substance, write a shorter edition
- Don't use clickbait subject lines that don't deliver
- Don't send without reading it out loud first

## Subject line formulas

- **The number:** "3 things I learned from [specific experience]"
- **The question:** "Why does [common practice] never work?"
- **The story:** "The email that changed my [business/approach/thinking]"
- **The contrarian:** "Stop [thing everyone does]"
- **The specific:** "[Exact result] in [exact timeframe]. Here's how."

## Cadence

- Weekly or biweekly. Pick one and be consistent.
- Same day, same time. Train your readers to expect you.
- If you miss a week, don't apologize — just send the next one.

## Growth tactics

- End every issue with "If you found this useful, forward it to one person who'd benefit"
- Cross-promote on LinkedIn and Twitter (different angles for each)
- Guest write for newsletters with overlapping audiences
- Add a subscribe CTA to your LinkedIn featured section
