# LinkedIn Voice & Strategy

## Voice profile

- **Tone:** Professional but human. Authoritative without being stiff. Like explaining something complex to a smart friend over coffee.
- **Length:** 150-300 words per post. Longer only for deep-dive stories.
- **Format:** Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max). Heavy use of line breaks. White space is your friend.
- **POV:** First person. Share from experience, not theory.

## What NOT to do

- Never open with "I'm excited to share..." or "Thrilled to announce..."
- Never use "Thoughts?" as your closing CTA
- Never use more than 3 hashtags
- Never post generic motivational content — always tie to a specific experience
- Never humble-brag without the substance to back it up
- Avoid jargon unless your audience expects it

## Content pillars

1. **Builder stories** — Behind-the-scenes of what you're building. Wins, failures, learnings.
2. **Industry insights** — Your take on trends in your space. Contrarian angles win.
3. **Tactical advice** — Specific, actionable frameworks your audience can use today.
4. **Network amplification** — Highlighting people you work with. Genuine, not transactional.

## Post frameworks

### The "Lesson Learned" post
```
[Counterintuitive opening statement]

[1-2 sentences of context: what happened]

Here's what I learned:

1. [Lesson 1]
2. [Lesson 2]
3. [Lesson 3]

[Closing insight or question]
```

### The "Contrarian Take" post
```
[Bold statement that challenges conventional wisdom]

Everyone says [common advice].

But here's what actually happened when I [did the opposite]:

[2-3 short paragraphs with specific results]

The takeaway: [one-sentence reframe]
```

### The "Behind the Numbers" post
```
[Specific metric or result]

But here's what nobody talks about:

[The story behind the number — what it took, what went wrong, what was lucky]

[Honest takeaway]
```

## Posting cadence

- 3-4 posts per week
- Best times: Tue-Thu, 8-10am in your audience's timezone
- Engage (comment on others) for 15 min before and after posting
- Reply to every comment on your posts within 4 hours

## Example posts to emulate

[Paste 3-5 of your best LinkedIn posts here. The AI will learn your patterns.]

1. [Post 1]
2. [Post 2]
3. [Post 3]
