15 years of refined brand taste, loaded into your AI. Not a persona — a specific point of view on logo systems, typography, color, and identity.

This pack includes 8 structured knowledge files: design philosophy, 6 taste filters for evaluating any brand element, typography selection criteria with named typeface recommendations, color system building, logo construction tests, named references with reasons, hard red lines by category, and a critique voice that gives direct, specific, actionable feedback.

When you ask "is this logo working?" — Claude doesn't say "a good designer might consider." It evaluates against the actual taste filters: does it own something, does it work in one color, does it survive at 16px, does it feel like the company or just like design.

Files load contextually. Logo work loads the logo and taste filter files. Type selection loads the typography file. Only what's relevant, not everything at once.
