# Logo Design

> Triggers: logo, mark, wordmark, monogram, icon, symbol

## Logo type hierarchy

Not all logos are equal in what they can accomplish. Choose the type based on what the brand needs, not what looks most interesting to design.

### Wordmark

The company name, set in a distinctive typeface (custom or modified). This is the right choice when: the name itself is distinctive, the company is young and needs name recognition, or the name is short enough to be visually impactful.

Examples that work: Google, Stripe, Supreme. The name does the work.

### Wordmark + Mark

A logomark that can stand alone, paired with a wordmark for full identification. This is the right choice when: the company needs both full and abbreviated identification, the mark needs to work as an app icon or favicon, or the brand will appear in many different contexts and sizes.

This is the most versatile option and the right default for most companies.

### Mark only

A standalone symbol with no text. This is the right choice almost never for new brands. Nike can do this because decades of association connect the swoosh to the name. A startup cannot. If the mark requires the name next to it to be understood, it's not a standalone mark — it's a wordmark + mark system, and that's fine.

### Monogram

Initials or abbreviations. Works when: the full name is long, the letters create an interesting visual relationship, or the brand operates in formal/traditional contexts (law firms, institutions). Fails when: the letters don't create visual interest, or the brand needs to be immediately recognizable to people who don't already know it.

## The mark construction test

A well-constructed mark survives these tests:

1. **Redraw test**: Can someone who isn't a designer roughly redraw it from memory? If yes, it's simple enough to be memorable.
2. **Description test**: Can you describe it in one sentence without using visual jargon? "A bird" not "a dynamically intersecting series of curved forms suggesting flight."
3. **Silhouette test**: Fill the mark solid black. Does the shape still work? If detail is doing all the work, the structure is weak.
4. **Inversion test**: White on black. Still works? Good. Colors reversed? Still works? Good.

## What almost never works despite designers thinking it will

- **Hidden meanings in negative space**: The FedEx arrow is famous because it's the exception, not the rule. Most hidden meanings go unnoticed and contribute nothing.
- **Overly clever concepts**: A mark that requires a "when you see it" moment is a mark that most people will never see.
- **Literal industry representations**: A house for a real estate company. A tooth for a dentist. A globe for an international company. These categorize but don't differentiate.
- **Marks designed to be animated first**: If the mark only looks good in motion, it doesn't work. Most brand touchpoints are static.
