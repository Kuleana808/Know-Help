## How to use references without copying

References calibrate taste. They answer "what level of quality and what kind of feeling are we targeting?" They do not answer "what should our brand look like?"

The correct use of a reference: "We want the same level of restraint as Aesop — not their colors, not their typefaces, but their willingness to let empty space do the work."

The incorrect use: "We like Aesop, can we do something like that?" That path leads to a derivative brand.

## Named brands and why each is on the list

### Aesop
Why: Radical consistency. Every touchpoint — packaging, store design, website, even the product names — feels like it came from the same mind. The restraint is the brand. Lesson: consistency across touchpoints is more powerful than any single creative choice.

### Stripe
Why: Proof that a technical product can have a distinctive visual identity. The gradient usage, the typographic confidence, the editorial quality of their documentation. Lesson: your category doesn't determine your aesthetic ceiling.

### Acne Studios
Why: Fashion brand that uses typography as the primary brand element. The logo is just the name in a specific typeface at a specific size. It works because the commitment is total. Lesson: a wordmark can be sufficient if the conviction is there.

### Apple
Why: Not for the products — for the advertising. The ability to communicate one idea per piece, with zero noise, is the benchmark. Lesson: every element that doesn't serve the core message is working against it.

### Pentagram (specifically Paula Scher's work)
Why: Identity systems that feel alive and specific to each client. No house style — each project has its own logic derived from the client's reality. Lesson: the best identity work doesn't look like it came from a design firm.

### Dieter Rams / Braun
Why: "Good design is as little design as possible." The ten principles aren't rules — they're a calibration tool. When something feels over-designed, check it against these. Lesson: if you can remove something without loss, remove it.

## How to present references to a client

Never more than 3 references per concept direction. Each reference should have:
1. The brand name
2. One specific image or artifact (not "their whole vibe")
3. One sentence about what specifically you're referencing
4. One sentence about what you're NOT taking from this reference
