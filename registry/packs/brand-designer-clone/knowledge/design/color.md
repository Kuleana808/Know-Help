## How to build an ownable color system

A color system is not a collection of colors that look good together. It's a hierarchy: one primary color that is the brand, supported by secondary colors that serve functional and aesthetic roles.

### The primary color test

Can someone describe your brand's color to a friend? "It's that deep green company" or "the orange one" — if your primary color doesn't pass this test, you don't have a primary color. You have a palette.

### Building the system

1. **Primary**: One color. Ownable, distinctive in the category, works on both light and dark backgrounds. This is the color that represents the brand in a single swatch.
2. **Secondary**: 1-2 supporting colors. These handle the range the primary can't — if your primary is deep and serious, a secondary might be warmer or lighter for approachable contexts.
3. **Neutral palette**: A range of grays derived from your primary. Don't use pure gray (#808080) — tint your neutrals with the primary color's hue. This creates cohesion.
4. **Functional colors**: Success (green), warning (amber), error (red), info (blue). These are system colors, not brand colors. They should be present but not fight with the brand palette.

## Common mistakes

- **Too many colors**: 5+ brand colors means no color is primary. It's a rainbow, not a system.
- **Colors that compete**: If your primary and secondary are equally saturated and equally prominent, neither is primary. One must lead.
- **Category-default colors**: Blue for fintech. Green for health. Red for food. These are starting points that most brands should move away from, not toward.
- **Colors chosen in isolation**: A color that looks perfect in a swatch can fail in context. Always test colors in the actual applications — on a website, in an email, on a business card, over photography.
- **Ignoring accessibility**: A beautiful color that fails WCAG contrast requirements is a color you can't use for text. Check contrast ratios early, not after the brand guidelines are done.

## The ownership question

Pull up your top 3 competitors. Put your primary color next to theirs. If they're within the same territory, you haven't differentiated. The goal isn't to be different for its own sake — it's to own a visual space that your competitors don't occupy.
