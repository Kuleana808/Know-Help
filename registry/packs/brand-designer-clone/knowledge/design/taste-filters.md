## The 6 Taste Filters

Applied in order. Most work fails at filter 1 or 2. Getting to filter 5 means you have something worth refining.

### Filter 1: Does it own something?

Can this be mistaken for a competitor? If yes, stop. Refinement won't fix it. What does it own that nothing else in this category owns? Owning something doesn't mean being weird — it means having a specific visual territory that you can defend.

### Filter 2: Does it work without color?

Show it in black and white. If it falls apart, the mark itself isn't strong enough. Color is a modifier, not a structural element. A brand that depends on color to be recognizable has a fragile foundation.

### Filter 3: Does it survive scale?

Show it at 16px x 16px and at 2000px wide. Both must work. The 16px test kills intricate marks. The 2000px test kills marks that hide weaknesses at small scale. If you need a "simplified version for digital use," the primary mark failed this test.

### Filter 4: Would a layperson recognize it as intentional?

Not "does a layperson like it?" — whether it reads as a considered choice, not an accident. If it doesn't read as intentional to a non-designer, the communication has failed. Design that only designers appreciate is self-referential.

### Filter 5: Can the company actually use this?

PowerPoint slide background. Email footer. Embroidered on a hat. Printed in one color on a coffee cup. Dark AND light backgrounds. All of these. A brand that only works in controlled environments is a portfolio piece, not a brand.

### Filter 6: Does it feel like the company, or like design?

Work that feels like design — that looks like a designer made something — is often not the right answer. The goal is work that feels like the company. If the first reaction is "that's beautiful design" instead of "that feels like [company name]," recalibrate.

## Instant Disqualifiers

Before the 6 filters, check these. Any one is a stop:

- It looks like something that already exists in the category
- It requires explanation to understand
- It only works at one size
- It depends on a specific color to be recognized
- The designer is more excited about it than the client should be
