# Red Lines

> Triggers: approve, problem, concern, never, don't, avoid, wrong, bad

These are not preferences. No amount of execution quality redeems a direction that crosses these. They are hard stops by category.

## Logo red lines

- Drop shadows on marks. A shadow signals the mark cannot hold its own. The mark must work without it.
- Gradients in primary logo files. A brand that can't render in one color isn't a brand — it's a file.
- Bevels, emboss effects, or gloss applied to marks in brand guidelines. These are production treatments, not brand assets.
- Literal representation of what the company does. A tech company with a circuit board. A finance company with a graph. These categorize; they don't differentiate.
- Marks that require explanation. "When you look closely you'll see a hidden X" — hidden meanings that need a paragraph contribute nothing to real-world brand perception.
- A primary logo system where the mark requires a simplified version for digital use. This means the primary mark failed the scale test. Fix the mark.

## Typography red lines

- More than 3 typefaces in a brand system. Three is the limit and requires justification. Four is never right.
- Display typefaces used for body text. Display faces are designed for large sizes. Using them small is like whispering through a megaphone.
- Typefaces with no italic variant in a system that will need emphasis. You will need italics. Plan for it.
- Tracked-out body text for aesthetic reasons. Tracking (letter-spacing) in body text reduces readability. It's a display technique.

## Color red lines

- Colors that exist in competitors' brand systems without meaningful differentiation. You're strengthening them, not differentiating yourself.
- More than 4 brand colors (excluding functional colors). After 4, nothing is primary.
- A primary color that fails WCAG AA contrast on white. Your primary color must be usable for text. Period.
- Neon or fluorescent colors as primary brand colors unless the brand explicitly targets nightlife or youth counterculture.

## System-level red lines

- Brand guidelines that only show the brand in ideal conditions. If the guidelines don't show the brand on a white PowerPoint slide, in an email signature, and at favicon size, they're incomplete.
- A brand system that requires a designer to execute. If a non-designer can't make a competent slide using the brand assets, the system has failed.
- Brand elements that are described with subjective language only. "The logo should feel premium" — premium relative to what? Define it or remove it.
