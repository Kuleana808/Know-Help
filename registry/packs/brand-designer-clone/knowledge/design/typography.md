## Type selection criteria

Typography is the most visible and least understood element of brand systems. A typeface carries cultural information — it signals era, intent, formality, and taste before a single word is read. Choosing type is choosing voice.

### The test

Would this typeface be right for a different company in a completely different industry? If yes, it's too generic. The typeface should feel inevitable for this brand, not interchangeable.

## Trusted typefaces with reasons

### Serif — Display

- **GT Sectra**: Authority with warmth. The wedge serifs give it edge without coldness. Works for brands that need to feel expert but approachable.
- **Freight Display**: Elegant without being precious. Beautiful at large sizes, maintains character at smaller ones. Good for editorial-feeling brands.
- **Canela**: Modern serif with a calligraphic quality. Feels human in a way most modern serifs don't. Use when warmth is the priority.
- **Tiempos Headline**: The workhorse. Professional, distinctive enough, never wrong. The safe-but-good choice.

### Serif — Text

- **Freight Text**: The text companion to Freight Display. Excellent readability, maintains the editorial feel.
- **Tiempos Text**: Pairs naturally with Tiempos Headline. Solid text face.
- **Source Serif Pro**: The reliable open-source option. Not exciting, but competent and free.

### Sans — Display

- **GT America**: Grotesque with character. More personality than Helvetica, less quirky than most alternatives.
- **Söhne**: The modern standard. Clean, well-drawn, works everywhere. If you need a sans that disappears, this is the right choice.
- **Graphik**: Warm grotesque. Friendlier than most sans-serifs without being casual.

### Sans — Text

- **Inter**: The best free option for UI and text. Designed for screens, works perfectly there.
- **Söhne**: Works at text sizes too. Versatile enough for full-system use.

### Monospace

- **DM Mono**: Clean, modern, good weight range. Works for technical brands and code-adjacent contexts.
- **JetBrains Mono**: Excellent for actual code display. Ligatures are a bonus.
- **IBM Plex Mono**: The reliable choice. Never wrong for technical contexts.

## What to avoid and why

- **Helvetica / Arial**: Not wrong, but never right either. They signal "we didn't choose a typeface." They're the absence of a decision.
- **Papyrus / Comic Sans**: Obviously. But also: any typeface whose name you recognize from a meme has been culturally poisoned.
- **Free fonts with incomplete character sets**: A typeface that breaks when someone types an em-dash is not a brand typeface.
- **Typefaces with only one weight**: You need at minimum regular and bold. Ideally regular, medium, and bold. A single weight is a constraint that will cost you.

## Pairing logic

- Maximum 2 typefaces in most systems. 3 requires justification.
- The pairing should create contrast, not harmony. Serif + Sans is a pairing. Two similar sans-serifs is a collision.
- Test the pairing at the extremes: the smallest body text and the largest headline on the same page. If they don't feel like they belong together at both sizes, the pairing isn't working.
