# The Brand Designer Clone

15 years of refined brand taste, loaded into your AI. Not a persona — a specific point of view on logo systems, typography, color, and identity.

## What's in this pack

|------|-------------|----------|
| `design/philosophy.md` | What brand actually is. Simplicity, trends, looking good vs. being right. | brand, identity, visual |
| `design/taste-filters.md` | 6 sequential filters to evaluate any brand element. Instant disqualifiers. | evaluate, review, critique |
| `design/typography.md` | Type selection criteria. Named trusted typefaces with reasons. | font, typeface, type |
| `design/color.md` | How to build an ownable color system, not a collection. | color, palette |

## How it's different from a Claude Project

A Clone pack is not a persona. It's evidence. Specific taste artifacts, reference decisions, red lines, and critique examples from a real point of view.

The difference between "act like a designer" and "here are this designer's actual taste filters, diagnostic frameworks, and hard red lines." The second is substantively more useful and can't be replicated by a system prompt.

## Theme

This pack uses a dark, editorial aesthetic on its public page — the page design itself demonstrates the designer's taste.

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "mode": "dark",
    "accent": "#b8965a",
    "fonts": {
      "serif": "Cormorant Garamond",
      "mono": "DM Mono"
    }
  }
}
```
